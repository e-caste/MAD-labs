## Notes

### General

Our custom log tag is `"MAD-group-27"`.

### Lab2

We have made a function that creates some randomized trips at the first startup of the application (found at `<pkg>.utils.kt.createSampleDataIfNotPresent()`).  
Since multi-threading was not required for this delivery, you may experience a few seconds of delay when you first launch the app.
